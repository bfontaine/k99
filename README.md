# 99 K Problems

This repository represents my attempt at learning [K][] using the open-source
implementation [Kona][].

[K]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)
[Kona]: https://kona.github.io/#/

## Setup

[Install Kona](https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona#installation). On macOS with
Homebrew you can use the following command:

    brew install bfontaine/languages/kona


## Solutions

You can test the solutions with the following command:

    echo | k k99.k k99_test.k

* `k99.k` contains the solutions
* `k99_test.k` contains basic tests

## Resources

It is unsurprisingly hard to find resources about K given its name and the size
of its community (small).

* [Konaâ€™s wiki](https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona/wiki)
* [Intro to K](https://www.cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall02/G22.3033-007/kintro.html)
* [Verbs](https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona/wiki/Verbs-Classification) aka
  basic operations
