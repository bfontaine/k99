## Problem 33 (2.05)
Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Example: 28 = 5 + 23. It is one of the most famous facts in number theory that has not been proved to be correct in the general case. Find the two prime numbers that sum up to a given even integer.

### Example
````k
  goldbach 28
5 23
````

## Problem 34 (2.06)

 14 3 11
 16 3 13
 18 5 13

## Problem 35 (2.07)
Determine the greatest common divisor of two positive integer numbers.

### Example
````k
  gcd[36;63]
9
````

## Problem 36 (2.08)
Determine whether two positive integer numbers are coprime.
Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals 1.

### Example
````k
  coprime[35;64]
1
  coprime[35;63]
0
````

## Problem 37 (2.09)
Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m).
Euler's so-called totient function phi(m) is defined as the number of positive integers r (1 <= r < m) that are coprime to m.

### Example
````k
  phi 10
4
````

## Problem 38 (2.10)
Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m)(2).
If the list of the prime factors of a number m is known in the form of problem 2.03 then the function phi(m) can be efficiently calculated as follows: Let [[m1,p1],[m2,p2],[m3,p3],...] be the list of prime factors (and their multiplicities) of a given number m. Then phi(m) can be calculated with the following formula:

````k
phi(m) = (p1 - 1) * p1^(m1 - 1) * (p2 - 1) * p2^(m2 - 1) * (p3 - 1) * p3^(m3 - 1) * ...
````

### Example
````k
  phi2 10
4
````

## Problem 39 (2.11)
Compare the two methods of calculating Euler's totient function.

### Example
````k
  \t phi 10090
806
  \t phi2 10090
7
````
